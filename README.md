# ad-challenge

## Members:
This project is built by the team comprising of the following members (in alphabetical order):

* David Fung
* Isaac Wong
* Jeffrey Li
* Nadim Rai

## Brainstorming:
After brainstorming together, we come to the conclusion that, among other business ideas, the best idea is to build a site to host the platform for Advertisement Challenge.

This Ad-challenge site is a platform for Advertisers to list their products to solicit video clips to compete for a prize. The best video which advertises the product will win.

## Development:
The development went through the following steps:
* UI design
* Data model design
* Software architecture (ember component) design

We practiced changing partners daily and assigned component changes to the strengths and preferences of our members.

We make use of github to collaborate together and have assigned Nadim Rai to facilitate the code merge:
* All members are equal contributors to the project;
* github statistics do not reflect the contribution level of individual member.
